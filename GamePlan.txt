Requirements:
1. Must include at least two classes
    a. Focus on planning two classes
    b. Creating a basis constructor __init__() method

Game idea: Text adventure
    1. Spaceship - 5 rooms
    2. Broken engine and has to be fixed
    3. Helper droid - can repair items?

Necessary classes:
    1. Player
    2. Room
    3. Droid
    4. Items

    Probably need a "create_player" function that the player inputs all of the initial information selectable by the player
    and then calculates max hp and max move points

Repair_item needs:
    1. likelihood of repair success
        if (player.repair_skill + random.randint(0, 20) * .70 >= item.condition 
    2. likelihood of horrible failure - include this 
    3. amount of increase on success
    4. amount of decrease on horrible failure
    5. increase skill score based on amount of practices (can do this with an attribute self.repair_prac in Player)
